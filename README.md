Project Title: Predicting Olympic Medal Counts: A Comparative Analysis of Statistical and Machine Learning Models

# Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop predictive models that estimate the number of medals won by each country at the Rio Olympics in 2016 using data from 2012 Olympic Games and other related socio-economic variables. This involves identifying key factors that influence Olympic performance, evaluating the effectiveness of different statistical models, and suggesting ways to improve predictions for future Olympic events.

# Background:
The Olympic Games are a global event where nations compete across various sports. Predicting the number of medals a country might win is a complex task, influenced by numerous factors such as economic strength, population, historical performance, and political background. Accurate predictions can be valuable for national sports committees, sponsors, and analysts interested in understanding the determinants of Olympic success.

In this project, we use data from previous Olympics, particularly focusing on the 2012 London Olympics, to build models that predict the medal counts for the 2016 Rio Olympics. By comparing different modeling approaches, including Poisson regression, Negative Binomial regression, and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), we aim to determine which methods offer the most accurate predictions and why.
